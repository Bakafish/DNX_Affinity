=============================================================================

*** Revision xx: Released dnx-0.15: dd-mmm-yy jcalcote

* Revision: 172-169: 29-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Updated ChangeLog.  Added nagios 3.0 rc2 patch.  Removed old makefiles.  
Added dnxstats program as a management tool.  

* Revision: 168-164: 24-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Fixed logging system logic bug in dnxLogInit.  Fixed memory leak in WLM.  
Added dynamic run path for pid file to command line parameters for client; 
allows for better unit testing.  Fixed strcmp case issue in dnxLogging.c.  
Fixed double free bug in dnxTransport.c.  Fixed makefiles for make check 
with debug heap enabled.  Fixed segfault in config parser - free variables 
code.  Fixed problems with building checks with debug heap enabled.  

* Revision: 163-162: 23-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Changed logging/auditing interface to be file based.  This change touches 
90 percent of the source code because the name of the logging function was 
changed.  Added code to copy config dictionary, rather than just store the 
user-supplied pointer.  

* Revision: 161-159: 22-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Fixed strdup bug in new config parser code - should have been xstrdup.  
Enhanced configuration parser to handle command line overrides; passed 
null cmd line override strings in dnxNebMain.c and dnxClientMain.c for 
now.  Added configuration parser object so we could localize the 
initialization data for a configuration parser.  This is also in 
preparation to adding command-line overrides of configuration file 
parameters.  

* Revision: 158: 21-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Abstracted away all knowledge of nagios internal data structures from any 
file except dnxNebMain.c.  Refactored results posting code for nagios 2.x 
and nagios 3.x.  

* Revision: 157: 20-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Slight change to nagios 3 patch.

* Revision: 156-155: 19-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Updated ChangeLog.  Renamed nagios 2.x patch so it's obvious that it works 
against nagios 2.8, 9 and 10; updated the nagios read me file.  

* Revision: 154: 18-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Added conditional code to make dnx compile and work under nagios 3.x 

* Revision: 153: 17-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Modified nagios directory structure; only require one set of Nagios 2.x 
header files and 2 patch files for all Nagios 2.x releases.  

* Revision: 152-149: 16-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Added code to log individual configuration changes.  Removed prefix from 
/etc reference in dnxcld.init.in Repointed PID file at /var/run - this IS 
the global state directory for all running instances.  Added mkdir for 
process state directory in case prefix is /usr/local.  

* Revision: 148-147: 14-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Fixed debug format string in dnxClientMain.c.  Added some startup messages 
to the client - config file, various important parameters; fix local 
interface lookup code in the WLM.  Fixed a few minor issues in the example 
config files.  

* Revision: 146: 12-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Reworked the configuration parser to deal with default parameters cleanly; 
reworked reconfiguration of the client such that nothing is overwritten if 
any portion of the reconfig process fails; changed some text in the 
example configuration files; changed the name of the debug parameter to 
debugLevel in both client and server; changed the name of the maxTimeouts 
parameter to maxRetries.  

* Revision: 145-144: 10-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Now return better errors from config parser; added code to log config 
changes in WLM.  Ran dos2unix on dnx*.cfg files in etc.  

* Revision: 143-140: 09-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Added configured sysconfdir to client and server for default configuration 
file paths.  Fix a few rpm spec file and init script errors.  Fix memcmp 
of XID's in dnxJobList.c - XID fields are padded on 64-bit machines making 
memcmp a bad way to compare XID's.  Added rpm/ to location of spec file in 
Makefile.am for rpm build.  

* Revision: 139: 08-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Added code to configure.ac and Makefile.am to get rpm build working from 
make.  

* Revision: 138: 07-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Fixed lookup bug in XID management of node requests and registrar; Fixed 
job syslog and debug messages throughout; added code to cache proper local 
ip node address in both binary and string format.  

* Revision: 137-136: 04-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Updated ChangeLog.  Removed work load manager thread; pushed all pool 
management onto workers.  Changed debug levels for most dnxDebug messages 
so they are a bit more spread out; level 1 is now reasonable to watch in 
the log file.  

* Revision: 135-131: 03-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Switched back to second resolution on the WLM wakeup timer - it appears 
that pthread_cond_timedwait doesn't much care for milliseconds.  Changed 
WLM poll interval to use millisecond resolution instead of second 
resolution.  Increased queue size to twice service queue size in order to 
handle bursts.  (last checkin) reorganized entire transport subsystem such 
that transports can be loaded and configured at runtime if desired now.  
(this checkin) changed protocol slightly to allow for backward 
compatibility between server and client.  Ensured that all serial-slot 
messages were printed in the same format.  

* Revision: 130: 01-JAN-08 jcalcote 
Cleaned up protocol module.  Cleaned up xml module; added dnxXmlCmpStr to 
avoid allocation management for strings we're just verifying and throwing 
away.  

* Revision: 129: 31-DEC-07 jcalcote 
Combined dnxConnect.h into dnxTransport.h; internalized data structures 
and static functions in transport module.  

* Revision: 128-127: 30-DEC-07 jcalcote 
Added utesthelp.h to common/Makefile.am noinst_HEADERS.  Added registrar 
unit tests; cleaned up service check handler a little.  

* Revision: 126-123: 29-DEC-07 jcalcote 
Added dispatcher unit tests.  Added utesthelp.h to manage unit test CHECK 
macros.  Added unit test to dnxCollector.c.  Updated other unit tests to 
use utesthelp.h.  Set client worker thread receive timeout back to 1 times 
the configured value.  Fixed a bug in the config parser that was not 
allowing default values to carry through; objectized plugin module and xml 
module; wrote unit tests for xml module; general cleanup.  

* Revision: 122: 17-DEC-07 jcalcote 
Finished up index.html web page; Added team photos to about.html page.  

* Revision: 121-118: 15-DEC-07 jcalcote 
Made minor updates to the about.html page.  Updated contributing.html and 
added content to about.html.  Fixed one doxygen bug in logging interfaces.  
Added contributing.html content to web site; Fixed up formatting for 
doxygen source comments for some of the source files.  

* Revision: 117-111: 12-DEC-07 jcalcote 
Updated ChangeLog.  Changed dnxExecuteJob to display local node address 
rather than remote job source address in DNX results messages.  Add node 
address to (DNX: *) results output by the DNX client.  Added a debug 
message about job completion status to dnxExecuteJob.  Fixed segfault in 
dnxPlugin; was due to recent changes in dnxPlugin.c.  Converted neb module 
to new config parser.  Cleaned up doxygen comments in neb module source 
files.  Cleaned up dnxPlugin; fixed doxygen errors throughout.  

* Revision: 110: 11-DEC-07 jcalcote
Finished client rework; reorganized work load manager and worker thread 
pool.  Added new config parser; added reconfig logic (via SIGHUP).  

* Revision: 109-107: 10-DEC-07 jcalcote
WLM changes complete.  Intermediate commit; Change dnxChannel to 
DnxChannel; cleaned up client main code; objectized the work load manager.  
Generisized logging functionality - commit in preparation for move to 
common directory.  

* Revision: 106: 07-DEC-07 jcalcote
Changed all references to "GUID/Guid/guid" to "XID/xid" (except for xml 
wire buffer attribute names - that would break client/server compatibility 
- we'll do it at the last minute before the release.) Cleaned up a few 
doxygen issues.  Fixed a logging/return value error in the registrar.  

* Revision: 105-100: 06-DEC-07 jcalcote
Fixed a few cancellation issues in the 4 server threads.  Added 
cancelability back into dispatcher and collector threads.  Added 
cancelability back to registrar thread.  Added cancelability back into 
timer thread.  Changed timer resolution to milliseconds (mostly for 
testing).  Added nagios 2.10 to the nagios target list - configure 
--with-nagios-2_10.  Added dnxQueue.c unit tests.  

* Revision: 99-95: 05-DEC-07 jcalcote
Added unit tests for dnxTimer.c; incorporated them into build system check 
target. Completely abstracted DnxJobList away from nagios by replacing 
the service member of the DnxNewJob structure with a void * payload 
member. Added DnxJobList unit tests to dnxJobList.c and added appropriate 
autotools infrastructure to build and run the test. Temporarily removed 
thread cancellation logic; replaced with shutdown flags in thread 
procedure loops. Ensured all kernel waits were timed so these flags would 
take effect. Debugged shutdown logic; ensured that all threads and 
objects were cleaning up properly on shutdown. Fixed memory leak in xml 
buffer code. Commonized nagiosPostResults functions found in timer and 
collector. Moved common version into dnxNebMain.c in preparation for 
moving it into the dnx nagios patch. 

* Revision: 96: 03-DEC-07 jcalcote
Added debug heap; enable with -DDEBUG_HEAP on the compiler command line. 

* Revision: 95-91: 30-NOV-07 jcalcote 
Updated ChangeLog. Forgot to add new Makefile.am. Fixed a few issues 
with distcheck target; fixed a few runtime issues due to code churn. 
Instrumented code for debug heap. Cleanup DnxJobList object. Moved timer 
into job list as an aggragated sub-component. Cleaned up nebmain a bit 
more - ensured that cleanup was done in opposite order of init. 

* Revision: 90-84: 29-NOV-07 jcalcote
Fixed a few doxygen comment headers to reflect parameter changes. 
Objectized collector. Cleaned up dnxNebMain.c. Got rid of most of the 
globals. Objectized the dispatcher service. Also added node address to 
DNX Service Check Timeout message in dnxTimer.c. Objectized job 
expiration timer. Enhanced rpm.spec.in file. Objectized DnxQueue. 
Abstracted the queue data type by hiding the implementation. Registrar is 
the only object to use the queue, so moved queue management completely 
under registrar. Added rpm directory to root Makefile.am as extra dist. 

* Revision: 83-80: 28-NOV-07 jcalcote
Updated dnxClient init script to be lsb compliant. Added code to build 
system to generate client init script based on install prefix. Objectized 
the registrar. Fixed one typo, and included assert.h in several common 
files after adding doxygen function headers in common code. Added doxygen 
function headers to common code modules. General cleanup in common code. 

* Revision: 79-74: 27-NOV-07 jcalcote
Added one doc parameter to dnxNebMain.c. Fixed static function ordering in 
dnxNebMain.c. Added doxygen headers to dnx server functions and 
procedures. Changed DNX server (service check) timeouts from critical to 
unknown. Changed DNX client (plugin) timeouts from unknown to critical. 
Fixed a couple of compile defects since adding doxygen comments to 
functions in client code - all in client/dnxConfig.cpp. Add doxygen 
comment headers to all procedures and functions in the client. 

* Revision: 73-69: 26-NOV-07 jcalcote
Fixed typo in VerifyFacility. Cleaned up dnxClientMain.c a bit, added some 
information to message output in dnxDebug.h. Added dnxDebug.h to 
dnx/common/Makefile.am. Fixed typo in dnxClientMain.c. Added pthread debug 
routines in dnxDebug.h in dnx/common. Modified all pthread_mutex calls and 
some pthread_cond calls to use debug versions. 

* Revision: 68-66: 24-NOV-07 jcalcote
Added build script code to allow building against a particular set of 
nagios header files. Modified nagios-2.9 headers to be patched with the 
dnx patch file. Modified autotools build system to not build doxygen 
automatically, but only on doxygen target specification. Added\ doxygen 
build code to autotools build scripts. 

* Revision: 65-64: 23-NOV-07 jcalcote
Added nagios-2.9/include directory. Added nagios-2.9 patch contributed by

references the workflow pdf doc. Renamed Developer section to Contributor 
section in documentation.html page. Added a Developer section targeted to 
code developers using doxygen docs to learn the code base. Minor change to 
documentation page on web site - reference doxygen index.html from html 
directory instead of doxy directory. Add web pages; fill in documentation 
page. Reformat all web pages, convert tabs to spaces. Convert old TODO 
messages to doxygen @todo messages. Add a few missing header files after 
autonomy check. Rearrange header file inclusions to ensure header file 
autonomy. Add Makefile.am to doc directory. Tweak doxygen comments to 
remove all doxygen warning output. Added doxygen configuration files. More 
general file header cleanup. Added doxygen file header comments to every 
source module. 

* Revision: 52-47: 20-NOV-07 jcalcote
Added a null statement (;) after two labels in the threadpool - new C99 
rules. Remove old copyright headers, change original copyright holder to 
author. tabs to spaces throughout. Add Intellectual Reserve copyright 
header; standardize footer for all c and h files. A 5 seconds to job 
expiration time in dnxNebMain.c; swap checks in if statement in 
dnxJobList.c to make the check more efficient. Backing up to revision 12 - 
we can't change things that dramatically.
