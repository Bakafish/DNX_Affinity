OpenSuSE Build System (OBS)
---------------------------

The OpenSuSE Build System is available at http://build.opensuse.org. This
really cool project allows individual contributors to become the package
maintainer for their own package repositories. It also provides a nice 
compile farm, with the ability to produce packages for rpm based systems
and debian based systems, including OpenSuSE, SLES, SLED, RedHat Fedora, 
Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.

The files in this directory are used only in the process of building various
binary packages on the OpenSuSE Build System. The only exception to this 
statement is the dnx rpm spec file, which is also used to build rpm files 
from the command line using "make rpms".

While there are Debian spec files in this file set, they probably wouldn't 
be of much use outside of the OBS.
