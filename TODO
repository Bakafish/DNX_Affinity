# DNX TODO's (Updated 08-16-2007):
# ================================
#  1. Protect dnxClient from SIG alarms from plugins
#  2. Make it portable to all forms of *NIX that Nagios runs on
#  3. Extend the dnxClient API (restart, statistics, etc)
#  4. Implement the authorized worker node lock down
#  5. Implement debugging levels in the client
#  6. Perfect "in-client" checks using libraries (check_nrpe, check_icmp, check_snmp, check_nt, etc)
#  7. Optimize DNX Client response to increasing thread count by having each thread
#     check to see if all threads are busy (upon receive a new job to execute.)
#     If all threads are busy, then signal the WLM to wake-up early.
#  8. Make dnxClient run as the nagios user
# 99. Testing, Testing, and more Testing.
#
#
# Completed TODO's:
# =================
#  - Fix the local check regex (Fixed in version 0.11)
#  - Log which worker node performed each check for troubleshooting reasons (Added in version 0.12)
