 3. Drop privileges for dnxClient from root to user.
 4. Enhance localCheckPattern to multiple 3-tuples for {host,service,command}

 6. DNX adds data to check_* output indicating DNX failure information.

    b. dnxServer adds to failed jobs output.
 7. Implement the authorized worker node lock down
    a. Add ssl encryption to dnx channels.
    b. No unauthorized node can connect.
