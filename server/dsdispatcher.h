/** Implements the DNX Job List mechanism.
 *
 * The purpose of this thread is to dispatch service check jobs to the
 * registered worker nodes for execution.  It accomplishes this by
 * accepting work node registrations and then dispatching service check
 * jobs to registered worker nodes using a weighted-round-robin algorithm.
 * The algorithm's weighting is based upon the number of jobs-per-second
 * throughput rating of each worker node.
