# DNX Client Node Sample Configuration File
# Command line parameters are specified where applicable. 
# NOTE: Command line parameters override configuration file settings.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Communications Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OPTIONAL: Local agent command channel.
# The DNX client node will listen on this address for management commands
# such as SHUTDOWN, STATUS, etc. This parameter is required, and will cause
# the client node to fail to initialize if not specified. In order to bind the 
# agent command channel to all local NICs on a multi-homed system, the host 
# name or address portion of the URL should be set to either 0 or 0.0.0.0. If 
# the agent should be bound to only one NIC, then the desired local interface 
# address may be specified. The default channel agent URL is udp://0:12480.

#channelAgent = udp://0:12480

# REQUIRED: DNX server dispatcher address.
# The client sends job requests to the dispatcher using the address, port and
# protocol specified in this URL. This parameter is required, and will cause
# the client node to fail to initialize if not specified. There is no default
# value for this parameter. The client cannot initialize without knowing the
# URL of the dispatcher.

channelDispatcher = udp://10.1.1.1:12480

# REQUIRED: DNX server collector address. 
# The client posts results to the collector using the address port and
# protocol specified in this URL. This parameter is required, and will cause
# the client node to fail to initialize if not specified. There is no default
# value for this parameter. The client cannot initialize without knowing the
# URL of the collector.

channelCollector = udp://10.1.1.1:12481

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Workload Manager Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OPTIONAL: DNX client thread pool parameters. 
# These parameters define the initial size, minimum, maximum, and growth
# figures, respectively. The values are specified as numbers of threads. The
# default values are 20, 20, 100 and 10 (again, respectively). 

#poolInitial = 20
#poolMin = 20
#poolMax = 100
#poolGrow = 10

# OPTIONAL: DNX client work load manager poll interval.
# This value defines the number of seconds the work load manager will sleep 
# between executions of its thread pool management tasks. These tasks include
# scanning the thread pool list for zombie threads (threads that have died,
# but have not yet been joined) and adding threads to the pool under heavy
# load. The default value is 2 seconds.

#wlmPollInterval = 2

# OPTIONAL: DNX client shutdown grace period in seconds.
# This value defines the number of seconds the work load manager will wait
# for all thread pool threads to complete their final jobs during shutdown.
# This parameter should be set to the sum of the Nagios service_check_timeout 
# and the DNX threadRequestTimeout, for maximum effectiveness. The default 
# value is 35 seconds.

#wlmShutdownGracePeriod = 35

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Worker Thread Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OPTIONAL: DNX client worker thread request timeout.
# The threadRequestTimeout value is the amount of time (in seconds) that a 
# worker thread will wait for the server to send a job, after it's sent a 
# request for a job. If the worker does not receive a job within this time
# period, it will send a new job request to the dispatcher on the server.
# The default value is 5 seconds.

#threadRequestTimeout = 5

# OPTIONAL: DNX client worker thread retry count.
# The threadMaxRetries value specifies the number of times a worker thread 
# will request a job from the dispatcher, and then timeout waiting for a 
# job before it will simply give up and terminate. Assuming the server is 
# scheduling jobs evenly, after this many attempts, the worker assumes that
# it is unnecessary, and self-terminates. The default value is 12 retries.

#threadMaxRetries = 12

# OPTIONAL: DNX client worker thread Time-To-Live backoff value.
# The threadTtlBackoff value specifies a number of seconds LESS than the
# threadRequestTimeout value to be assigned to the expiration time of a job
# request. Job requests sent by DNX client nodes to the server's dispatcher
# thread have an expiration time associated with them. This expiration time
# is calculated as (threadRequestTimeout - threadTtlBackoff). The default
# value is 1 second.

#threadTtlBackoff = 1

# OPTIONAL: DNX client plugin path.
# This value is used to restrict plugins from executing from anywhere except 
# the path specified in this parameter. There is no default value for this 
# parameter. If this parameter is not specified, the client will execute the 
# exact command line passed by the server in each job sent to the client. If
# this parameter *IS* specified, then the DNX client will strip off the path 
# of the command line sent in each job request, and replace it with this path.
# This is a security feature, allowing a DNX client administrator to lock-down
# the location of DNX checks. The default value of this parameter is
# @libexecdir@

#pluginPath = @libexecdir@

# OPTIONAL: DNX client maximum result buffer size.
# This parameter allows the administrator to configure the maximum size of DNX
# check results buffers returned to the server's collector thread. The default
# value is 1024 bytes.

#maxResultBuffer = 1024

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General and Debug Logging
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OPTIONAL: General logging output file.
# Log messages may be directed to a log file though the use of this 
# variable. This option may also be specified on the command line with a 
# --logfile,-l <path> parameter. The parameter value may be any valid file 
# system path, or the keywords STDOUT or STDERR.

#logFile = STDOUT                          # default in debug mode
#logFile = @syslogdir@/dnxcld.log          # default in normal mode

# OPTIONAL: Debug logging output file.
# Debug log messages may be directed to a log file though the use of this 
# variable. This option may also be specified on the command line with a 
# --dbgfile,-D <path> parameter. The parameter value may be any valid file 
# system path, or the keywords STDOUT or STDERR.

#debugFile = STDOUT                        # default in debug mode
#debugFile = @syslogdir@/dnxcld.debug.log  # default in normal mode

# OPTIONAL: The DNX debug verbosity level.
# Set this parameter to non-zero to enable debug output to the debug log. The 
# higher the value, the more verbose the output. Note however that not every 
# level provides additional verbosity. Output to a given level is hard-coded 
# into DNX on a per-message basis. The default value is 0, which disables all 
# debugging output. This option may also be specified on the command line with
# a --dbglevel,-g <level> option.

#debugLevel = 0

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Daemon configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OPTIONAL: The DNX daemon user name or ID.
# Set this parameter to drop daemon privileges below root. The value may be
# a string or a numeric value. The DNX client will first attempt to interpret
# the value as a string, and then as a numeric value if the string is found 
# not to be a valid user name. The default value is "@dnx_user@". This option 
# may also be specified on the command line with a --user, -U <user> option.

#user = @dnx_user@

# OPTIONAL: The DNX daemon group name or ID.
# Set this parameter to drop daemon privileges below root. The value may be
# a string or a numeric value. The DNX client will first attempt to interpret
# the value as a string, and then as a numeric value if the string is found 
# not to be a valid group name. The default value is "@dnx_group@". This option 
# may also be specified on the command line with a --group, -G <group> option.

#group = @dnx_group@

# OPTIONAL: The DNX daemon run path.
# Set this parameter to specify the location of the lock/pid file. Note that
# the value of this parameter should be a path to a directory, not including
# the file name; the file name is generated by the DNX client daemon. The 
# default value of this option is @sysrundir@.

#runPath = @sysrundir@
